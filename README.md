AsyncWatch is a small library for watching javascript/node.js objects. It uses Object.defineProperty which makes it compatible with most browsers. Any changes happening within present tick will be called on the next available one.

## Features

  * Asynchronous execution (Changes are triggered on r`equestAnimationFrame` in browser and on `process.nextTick` in Node) 
  * Being Asynchronous means we donâ€™t have to worry about the execution flow, details below 
  * Works in Node and Browser 
  * No Dirty Checking or `Object.observe` 
  * Using `Object.defineProperty()` makes it compatible with all modern browser down to IE 9 
  * Order of watchers is preserved 
  * Deep watch properties 
  * Ability to inspect change type for Arrays (`init`,`splice`, `push`) 
  * Computed Properties 
  * Get old and new values in the change callback 
  * Can watch any type of Object for example Watching `DOM` `Node` properties and attributes 
  * Restoring watchers after objects are destroyed 
  * Can be used as the back-bone to create a custom efficient tow binding system 
  * Comprehensive test coverage

## Install

For browser:

 bower install async-watch --save

For Node.js projects

 npm install async-watch --save

## Examples

```jsvar AsyncWatch = require('async-watch').AsyncWatch; // not needed for browsersvar obj = {}; // creating an empty objectAsyncWatch(obj, 'a.b.c', function(value){ console.log('set', value);});// You can pass an array as well//AsyncWatch(obj, ['a', 'b', 'c'])```

 As you can see here, we start with an empty object. AsyncWatch will set a watcher on property "a", which knows about its descendands

 ```js obj.a = { b : { c : 1 } }; obj.a.b.c = 2; obj.a.b.c = 3; setTimeout(function(){ obj.a.b.c = 4; },0) ```

 The output will look like this:

 ```js set 3 set 4 ```

Callback is called on "transaction commit". Each transaction is a requestAnimationFrame tick. Surely, initialtransaction loop happens when first value is changed.

Worth mentioning: Transactions happen on demand, without "perpetual" loop or/and any other dirty checkers.

## Destroying a watcher

Destroys a watcher (does not destroy its descendants or similar watchers) ```jsvar watcher = AsyncWatch(obj, 'a', function(value) {});watcher.destroy(); ```

## Watching many objects

watchAll is not implemented yet, however subscriptions are introduced. Each watcher returns a "transaction" / watcher.

 ```jsvar obj = { a : 1, b : 2}var watcher1 = AsyncWatch(obj, 'a', function(value) {});var watcher2 = AsyncWatch(obj, 'b', function(value) {}); ```

```jsvar subscription = AsyncWatch.subscribe([watcher1, watcher2], function(changes){ console.log(changes)})```Subscribers' callback guarantees all watchers to be in sync.

Outputs:```js{a : 1, b: 2 }```

Unfortunately, subscriptions won't clean up themselves, you need to do it manually.

```jssubscription.unsubscribe();```

If you want to unsubscribe and destroy corresponding watchers:

```jssubscription.destroy();```

## Computed propertiesYou can define a computed property.

```jsvar obj = { firstName : "Bob", lastName : "Marley"}

AsyncComputed(obj, 'fullName', ['firstName', 'lastName'], self =>`Name is ${self.firstName} ${self.lastName}`);

obj.lastName = "Foo";obj.lastName = "Foo1";AsyncWatch(obj, 'fullName', (value) => { // Name is Bob Foo1});```## Watching arrays```jsvar obj = { users : [{name : "John"}, {name : "Bob"}]}

AsyncWatchArray(obj, 'users', function(array,events){ console.log(events);});

Triggers events: "init" "push" "splice"```
